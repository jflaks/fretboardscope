Fretboard Scope is a tool to help you learn relationships between patterns and scales on the fretboard.  You begin by selecting a chord to constrain the selections of scales which you want to display, then choose a specific scale from the suggestions listed.  By choosing different scales on each selector you can visualize how the patterns relate and how to move between them.
		
###Example
Leave the selector on a <strong>C major7</strong> chord, and choose <strong>"A min7 Arp"</strong> for the left column. You'll see fingerings for the arpeggio appear on the fretboard.  Try to pick out a comfortable fingering on your instrument and, starting on the first degree <strong>(1)</strong> up through <strong>b3, 5, b7</strong>.

Now, for the middle selector, again leaving the chord choice at <strong>C major7</strong>, choose <strong>"B min7 arp"</strong>.  The fingerings for this arpeggio appear alongside the original choice.  Play your original four notes, and you can see that two frets higher on your fretboard is the <strong>b7</strong> (flattened seventh degree) of the newly selected arpeggio.  Try playing up the original four notes then, starting from this 2-frets-higher note, play back down in the new arpeggio through <strong>b7, 5, b3, 1</strong> (ending up two frets above where you began).  

Finally choose an <strong>E Minor blues</strong> on the third column.   This is probably a familiar pattern.  Try to see how it fits in with what you've been playing, and try weaving a blue note phrasing in between your arpeggios.
		
###Other Controls		
Use the dropdown at the top to choose different tunings/instruments, and choose a different appearance for the fretboard with the Theme selector. You may also choose to unlink the key/chord selectors from each other by unchecking "link layers", allowing you to visualize patterns as they become available over changes in a song.

###Possible Additions##
* More tunings
* More themes		
* Possibility of a piano CSS / tuning? This would need a javascript line to add a class, and probably some fixed position styling for each fret
* Altered dominants
* Maybe split up maj7 / minor 7 keys into their position, eg "Minor 7 as II in major scale" versus "Minor 7 as VI in major scale"
